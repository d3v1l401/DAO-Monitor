# DAO Monitor

This project is born by necessity: I frequently use DAO as package delivery service and I would love to know when the 
courier deliveries the item in real time, instead of refreshing the web page every once in a while.

This little program loads the "tracks.txt" file, containing the list of delivery IDs and notify the user when the
package has been delivered, by checking every minute.

# Installation

Put it wherever you want, but remember to create the "tracks.txt" file in the same location of the executable and put a tracking ID for each line.

You can also put it to start with Windows' startup, so you don't have to execute it every time, if the list is empty the software will hang and wait for a manual reload (right-click the icon and click "Reload").
